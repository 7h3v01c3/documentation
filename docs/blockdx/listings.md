# Block DX Listings
[Block DX](/blockdx/setup) has over 100 [digital assets](/resources/glossary/#digital-asset) trading ([see below](/blockdx/listings/#listed-digital-assets)), with the number continuously growing as more are made compatible. There is complete trading pair freedom, totaling to over 5000 tradable pairs.

---

## Listing Process
A Block DX listing holds many benefits beyond just being traded on the exchange. Being listed means the asset has been integrated with the [Blocknet Protocol](/project/introduction), which powers Block DX, and allows other services to be built utilizing the asset. This extends the demand, utility, and accessibility of the asset to the rest of the ecosystem.

Getting listed on Block DX is 100% free. If you would like to have a digital asset listed, please ask a member of that project to fill out the [integration form](https://bit.ly/blocknet-compatibility).
