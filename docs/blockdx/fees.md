# Block DX Fee Structure

---

## Maker Fee
When creating an order on Block DX, there is no fee other than the transaction fee for the network of the token being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this token to another party.

Having no fee to place an order encourages market makers to add liquidity. This also makes it possible for a user to acquire the BLOCK needed to take orders.

---

## Taker Fee
When accepting an order on Block DX, a static fee of 0.015 [BLOCK](/blockchain/introduction) is charged at the time the order is taken. This fee is charged even if a trade is canceled or fails and is meant to discourage malicious behavior on the network. 

In addition to the 0.015 BLOCK fee, there is also the transaction fee for the network of the token being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this token to another party.

In a future update, there will be a percent-based fee thatâ€™s charged when accepting an order, but the details of this are not yet finalized.


---

## Fees Distribution
100% of trade fees are distributed to Service Node operators for supporting the network.
